# Decision Trees and K-nearest neighbours
Implementation of cross validation methods from scratch for k-nearest neighbours and decision trees.

Performed optimization of hyperparameters (k for k-nearest neighbours, tree depth, min sample splits, number of max features for decision trees)

Observed performance when using different dataset sizes
